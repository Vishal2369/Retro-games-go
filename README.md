# Retro Games

This repository contains a collection of retro games created using **Go** and the **Raylib** library. Each game includes sound effects and music, providing an immersive retro gaming experience. Below is an overview of the repository structure and details about the individual games.

## Repository Structure

```
retro-games/
  snake/       # Snake game implementation
  pong/        # Pong game implementation
  tetris/      # Tetris game implementation
```

Each folder represents a standalone Go project with its own `go.mod` and `go.sum` files. This allows each game to be built and run independently.

## How to Get Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vishal2369/Retro-games-go
   cd retro-games
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired game directory (e.g., `snake`, `pong`, or `tetris`).
   ```bash
   cd snake
   ```

3. Build and run the game:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

Make sure you have Go installed and configured on your system. You also need to install the Raylib bindings for Go.
